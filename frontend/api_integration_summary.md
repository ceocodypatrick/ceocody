# HARMONI Music Platform - API Integration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the API integration work completed for the HARMONI music platform prototype. The integration connects the frontend components to the backend API endpoints using Redux for state management and custom hooks for component integration.

## Components Connected to API

### Tracks Management

1. **TrackList Component**
   - Connected to tracks API for fetching and displaying tracks
   - Implemented sorting, filtering, and pagination
   - Added real-time track deletion functionality
   - Integrated with Redux store for state management

2. **TrackDetails Component**
   - Connected to track API for fetching individual track details
   - Implemented analytics data fetching for the stats tab
   - Added error handling and loading states
   - Connected track actions (play, edit, delete) to appropriate handlers

3. **TrackUpload Component**
   - Connected to file upload API for audio files
   - Implemented progress tracking during upload
   - Added validation and error handling
   - Integrated with track creation API after successful upload

### Releases Management

1. **ReleaseList Component**
   - Connected to releases API for fetching and displaying releases
   - Implemented filtering by release type (singles, EPs, albums)
   - Added view mode switching (grid/list)
   - Integrated with Redux store for state management

2. **ReleasesPage**
   - Connected to releases API for fetching release statistics
   - Implemented search functionality with debounce
   - Added error handling and loading states

## API Integration Architecture

### API Service Layer

Created a comprehensive API service layer with the following services:

1. **apiClient.js**
   - Configured axios instance with base URL and headers
   - Added authentication interceptors for token management
   - Implemented error handling and request/response transformations

2. **tracksService.js**
   - Implemented methods for track CRUD operations
   - Added file upload functionality for audio and cover images
   - Created methods for fetching track analytics

3. **releasesService.js**
   - Implemented methods for release CRUD operations
   - Added track management within releases (add/remove)
   - Created methods for distribution and analytics

4. **authService.js**
   - Implemented authentication methods (login, register, logout)
   - Added token management and refresh functionality

5. **analyticsService.js**
   - Created methods for fetching various analytics data
   - Implemented timeframe filtering and data aggregation

### Redux State Management

Enhanced Redux store with the following slices:

1. **tracksSlice.js**
   - Created async thunks for API operations
   - Implemented state management for tracks data
   - Added loading, error, and success states
   - Implemented filtering and pagination

2. **releasesSlice.js**
   - Created async thunks for API operations
   - Implemented state management for releases data
   - Added distribution status tracking
   - Implemented filtering and sorting

3. **analyticsSlice.js**
   - Implemented state management for analytics data
   - Added timeframe selection and data caching
   - Created data transformation utilities

4. **authSlice.js**
   - Enhanced with async thunks for authentication
   - Implemented token storage and management
   - Added user profile state management

### Custom Hooks

Created custom hooks for easier component integration:

1. **useTracks.js**
   - Wrapped Redux dispatch and selectors for tracks
   - Added convenience methods for common operations
   - Implemented pagination and filtering helpers

2. **useReleases.js**
   - Wrapped Redux dispatch and selectors for releases
   - Added convenience methods for release management
   - Implemented distribution helpers

3. **useAnalytics.js**
   - Created methods for fetching and processing analytics data
   - Implemented timeframe selection and data formatting
   - Added caching for performance optimization

## Implementation Approach

1. **Component-First Integration**
   - Updated components to use custom hooks instead of direct API calls
   - Maintained backward compatibility with existing components
   - Created updated versions of components to avoid breaking changes

2. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Started with core functionality (fetching data)
   - Added more complex operations (create, update, delete)
   - Implemented advanced features (filtering, sorting, pagination)

3. **Error Handling and Loading States**
   - Added comprehensive error handling at multiple levels
   - Implemented loading states with skeleton loaders
   - Added retry mechanisms for failed requests

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implemented data caching for frequently accessed information
   - Added pagination for large datasets
   - Used debounce for search inputs to reduce API calls

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Component Integration**
   - Connect remaining components to API endpoints
   - Implement ReleaseDetails component with API integration
   - Connect ReleaseForm component to create/edit functionality

2. **Enhance Music Player**
   - Implement waveform visualization with wavesurfer.js
   - Connect player to streaming API endpoints
   - Add playlist and queue management

3. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Set up Jest for frontend testing
   - Create test cases for critical components
   - Optimize performance for large catalogs

4. **Mobile Experience Enhancement**
   - Test and fix responsive design issues
   - Optimize touch interactions
   - Improve performance on mobile devices

## Conclusion

The API integration work has significantly enhanced the HARMONI music platform prototype by connecting the frontend components to the backend API endpoints. This integration provides a more realistic user experience with real data fetching, state management, and error handling. The next phase will focus on completing the remaining component integrations and implementing the music player functionality.
