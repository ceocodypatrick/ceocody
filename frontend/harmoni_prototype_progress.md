# HARMONI Music Platform - Prototype Progress Report

## Executive Summary

The HARMONI music platform prototype has made significant progress in connecting the frontend components to the backend API. We've successfully implemented the API service layer, enhanced Redux state management, created custom hooks for component integration, and connected several key components to the API. This integration provides a more realistic user experience with real data fetching, state management, and error handling.

## Completed Tasks

### Technical Issues Resolution

- âœ… Updated frontend dependencies
  - Updated Next.js from v13.4.4 to latest version (v15.4.2)
  - Downgraded TailwindCSS from beta v4.1.11 to stable v3.3.0
  - Updated PostCSS from v8.5.6 to stable v8.4.31
  - Updated next.config.js to remove deprecated 'swcMinify' option
  - Added missing chart.js and react-chartjs-2 dependencies

- âœ… Resolved backend security warnings
  - Updated nodemon to address semver vulnerability
  - Verified multer is up to date (v1.4.5-lts.2)

### API Integration Implementation

- âœ… API Service Layer
  - Created apiClient.js with axios instance and interceptors for authentication
  - Implemented API services for:
    - Authentication (authService.js)
    - Tracks management (tracksService.js)
    - Releases management (releasesService.js)
    - Analytics data (analyticsService.js)

- âœ… Redux State Management
  - Enhanced authSlice.js with async thunks for API integration
  - Created new Redux slices:
    - tracksSlice.js for track management
    - releasesSlice.js for release management
    - analyticsSlice.js for analytics data
  - Updated store.js to include new slices and configure middleware

- âœ… Custom Hooks
  - Created custom hooks for easier component integration:
    - useAnalytics.js for analytics data
    - useTracks.js for tracks management
    - useReleases.js for releases management

### Component Integration

- âœ… Dashboard Integration
  - Created enhanced-dashboard-updated.js with:
    - Integration with Redux store and API services
    - Real data fetching through custom hooks
    - Proper loading states and error handling
    - Interactive timeframe selection

- âœ… Tracks Management
  - Connected TrackList component to tracks API
  - Connected TrackDetails component to track API
  - Connected TrackUpload component to file upload API
  - Implemented error handling and loading states
  - Added pagination and filtering

- âœ… Releases Management
  - Connected ReleaseList component to releases API
  - Implemented filtering by release type
  - Added view mode switching (grid/list)
  - Implemented search functionality with debounce

## In Progress Tasks

### Component Integration

- ðŸ”„ Release Details Component
  - Connect to release API for fetching individual release details
  - Implement track listing and management within release
  - Add analytics data fetching for the stats tab

- ðŸ”„ Release Form Component
  - Connect to release creation/update API
  - Implement cover image upload functionality
  - Add track selection and ordering

### Music Player Implementation

- ðŸ”„ Waveform Visualization
  - Install wavesurfer.js dependency
  - Create WaveformPlayer component
  - Implement playback controls
  - Add interactive waveform seeking

- ðŸ”„ Playlist Management
  - Create playlist data model
  - Implement playlist CRUD operations
  - Add tracks to playlist functionality

- ðŸ”„ Queue Management
  - Implement play queue state management
  - Create queue UI components
  - Add track reordering functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Component Integration**
   - Connect ReleaseDetails component to release API
   - Connect ReleaseForm component to release creation/update API
   - Implement remaining form validations and error handling

2. **Implement Music Player**
   - Install and configure wavesurfer.js
   - Create WaveformPlayer component with visualization
   - Implement playlist and queue management

3. **Set Up Testing Framework**
   - Configure Jest for frontend testing
   - Create test utilities and mocks
   - Write test cases for critical components

4. **Optimize Performance**
   - Implement pagination for all list views
   - Add data virtualization for long lists
   - Optimize image loading and processing

## Technical Approach

Our approach to API integration has been methodical and component-focused:

1. **Service Layer First**: We started by creating a comprehensive API service layer that abstracts the API calls and provides a clean interface for the components.

2. **Redux Integration**: We enhanced the Redux store with async thunks and proper state management for API operations.

3. **Custom Hooks**: We created custom hooks that wrap the Redux dispatch and selectors to provide a simpler interface for components.

4. **Component Updates**: We created updated versions of components that use the custom hooks instead of direct API calls, maintaining backward compatibility.

5. **Progressive Enhancement**: We started with core functionality (fetching data) and progressively added more complex operations (create, update, delete).

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge**: Handling authentication and token management across API calls.
   **Solution**: Implemented axios interceptors to automatically add authentication headers and handle token refresh.

2. **Challenge**: Managing loading states and error handling consistently across components.
   **Solution**: Created standardized loading and error states in Redux slices and custom hooks.

3. **Challenge**: Ensuring backward compatibility with existing components.
   **Solution**: Created updated versions of components instead of modifying existing ones, allowing for gradual migration.

4. **Challenge**: Optimizing performance for large datasets.
   **Solution**: Implemented pagination and filtering on the server side to reduce data transfer and improve rendering performance.

## Conclusion

The HARMONI music platform prototype has made significant progress in connecting the frontend components to the backend API. The integration provides a more realistic user experience with real data fetching, state management, and error handling. The next phase will focus on completing the remaining component integrations, implementing the music player functionality, setting up testing, and optimizing performance.
